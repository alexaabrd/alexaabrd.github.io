		<div class="section-sublabel">MAT14X Redesign</div>
			The core of my sabbatical was to redesign College Math MAT14X to increase student success by using inquiry-based learning and projects. 
			My plan was to create 5 projects that covered the 5 topics of the course. I knew going in that I couldn't cover all the competencies, and 
			thus would have to supplement with lecture, a text, and/or homework or an online homework program. What I discovered is that I COULD cover 
			all the competencies, but I needed 13 projects to do it. Not only will this save students money (no text or online homework program), 
			but it will focus their attention on the projects. The projects will build not only math skills, but real-life skills including 
			technology (Word, Excel and PowerPoint). The projects will be engaging as students get to choose many of their own topics and there is minimal 
			busywork. During the redesign, considerable thought was dedicated to class structure. For example, how do students demonstrate their 
			knowledge without testing? I choose to have students demonstrate their knowledge through presentations (PowerPoint, poster boards, speeches, and 
			quotes/proposals). These communication skills will serve students well when they leave the classroom. 
			The syllabus reflects the results of the redesign. The redesigned class is not for the lazy, but should be beneficial to many -- 
			especially those who suffer from math/test anxiety and other disabilites. Two sections are scheduled for Fall 2019.<br><br>

		<div class="section-sublabel">Technology</div>
			During my sabbatical, I learned a lot about technology. <br>
			
			<div class="section-subsublabel">Websites: </div>I have never created a website even though I have wanted to for years. 
			What you are reading is a product of my learning. Kudos to my daughter Alexa for helping with he initial layout! I learned a lot
			about HTML, CSS and website design. I think the website is a success and will serve my students well.
			
			<div class="section-subsublabel">Calculators:</div>
			My plan was to learn more about the Casio graphing calculators and host a seminar for students and faculty. 
			During my sabbatical, I became more and more concerned with the costs associated with education -- graphing calculators cost about $100.
			I decided to investigate using smartphones in lieu of calculators. Many apps allow smartphones to be converted to graphing calculators. 
			There are legitimate concerns with allowing smartphones in the classroom -- distraction and cheating on exams are two of my biggest concerns. 
			To address the distraction concern, I will continue to require all phones to be quiet and away during class with the exception of exams. 
			To address the cheating concern, I will implement strict rules (airplane mode, silent mode, WiFi off, no other apps open, flat on desk)
			and a harsh punishment (failure of exam) if a rule is broken. I think this approach will work for me and my students.<br>
			
			<div class="section-subsublabel">Microsoft Office Suite:</div>
			My plan was to learn how to integrate Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a seamless manner. I did a lot of research and talked to a lot of people.
			Even though you should be able to do it, doing it proved to be too difficult. Especially when considering the student will have files in different
			environments and then will be sharing with me. Thus, I decided to keep the Office files separate for the MAT14X projects. 
			I did learn more about the individual programs. For example, in Word, my table building abilities 
			became more robust and I learned more about inserting images. In Excel, I learned more about creating plots and using mathematical functions, 
			as well as some of the limitations. For example, it is extremely tedious to create a simple box-and-whisker plot. I researched and learned about 
			the elements of a good PowerPoint. I created several PowerPoint inservice projects for my colleagues, and I will require my MAT14X students to 
			learn about and present using PowerPoint.
			
			<div class="section-subsublabel">Canvas:</div>
			I made a good faith effort to learn more about Canvas. I made an appointment with CTLE staff to populate my classes. 
			What I learned is that while Canvas may be a good platform for students, it does not work for me. 
			There are too many limitations and I don't like the inefficiencies (such as having to recreate the wheel for each class 
			and for each semester). This is what drove me to create this website. 
			I will use Canvas to post syllabi, direct students to this website, and for discusssions.
			
			<div class="section-subsublabel">Maple</div>
			Maple brands itself as "The Essential Tool for Mathematics." I participated in several Webinars offered by Maplesoft so that I 
			could integrate this powerful application into several of my classes.

		   <div class="section-sublabel">Classes Taken</div>
			My plan was to take 12 credits of graduate level, professional development courses through the University of the Pacific. 
			I completed 24 credits. The 8 courses were: Evaluating Student Learning, Instructional Methods, Human Learning, Emotional/Behavioral Disorders, 
			School Finance, Personal Finance, Teaching Tolerance, and School Violence - Teachers Making Schools Safe<br><br>
	  
		   <div class="section-sublabel">Reflections</div>
			Sabbaticals are a good thing. They allow time to reflect on our work instead of just doing our work. 
			I am extremely thankful to the District for this opportunity.<br><br>
			You can't keep doing things the same way and expect to have different results.<br><br>
			Our students are different than they were 20, 10, or 5 years ago.<br><br>
			One needs to embrace technology and the cost savings it provides.<br><br>
			Testing is not the only way to demonstrate mathematical knowledge and it punishes those 
			with test/math anxiety and those with other disabilities. <br><br>
			If you can save students money, why not do it. <br><br>
			I love skiing.<br><br>
			I love my job, but I will have no trouble transitioning to retirement.<br><br>
